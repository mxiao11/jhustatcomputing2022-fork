The **package was originally written by Hadley Wickham** while he was a graduate student at Iowa State University (he still actively maintains the package).\n\nThe package implements what might be considered a third graphics system for R (along with `base` graphics and `lattice`).\n\nThe package is available from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) via `install.packages()`; the latest version of the source can be found on the package's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2). Documentation of the package can be found at [the tidyverse web site](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).\n\nThe **grammar of graphics** represents **an abstraction of graphics ideas and objects**.\n\nYou can think of this as **developing the verbs, nouns, and adjectives for data graphics**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Note\n\nDeveloping such a **grammar allows for a \"theory\" of graphics** on which to build new graphics and graphics objects.\n\nTo quote from Hadley Wickham's book on `ggplot2`, we want to \"shorten the distance from mind to page\". In summary,\n\n> \"...the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a **mapping** from data to **aesthetic** attributes (colour, shape, size) of **geometric** objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system\" -- from *ggplot2* book\n:::\n\nYou might ask yourself \"Why do we need a grammar of graphics?\".\n\nWell, for much the same reasons that **having a grammar is useful for spoken languages**. The grammar allows for\n\n-   A more compact summary of the base components of a language\n-   An extension of the language to handle situations that we have not before seen\n\nIf you think about making a plot with the base graphics system, the plot is **constructed by calling a series of functions that either create or annotate a plot**. There's **no convenient agreed-upon way to describe the plot**, except to just recite the series of R functions that were called to create the thing in the first place.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nConsider the following plot made using base graphics previously.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(airquality, { \n        plot(Temp, Ozone)\n        lines(loess.smooth(Temp, Ozone))\n})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot of Temperature and Ozone in New York (base graphics)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow would one **describe the creation of this plot**?\n\nWell, we could say that we called the `plot()` function and then added a loess smoother by calling the `lines()` function on the output of `loess.smooth()`.\n\nWhile the base plotting system is convenient and it often mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data, there are **drawbacks**:\n\n-   You cannot go back once plot has started (e.g. to adjust margins), so there is in fact a need to plan in advance.\n-   It is difficult to \"translate\" a plot to others because there is no formal graphical language; each plot is just a series of R commands.\n:::\n\nHere is the same plot made using `ggplot2` in the `tidyverse`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nairquality %>%\n        ggplot(aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n        geom_point() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", \n                    se = FALSE) + \n        theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot of Temperature and Ozone in New York (ggplot2)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Note\n\nThe output is roughly equivalent and the amount of code is similar, but `ggplot2` allows for a more elegant way of expressing the components of the plot.\n\nIn this case, the plot is a **dataset** (`airquality`) with **aesthetic mappings** (visual properties of the objects in your plot) derived from the `Temp` and `Ozone` variables, a set of **points**, and a **smoother**.\n:::\n\nIn a sense, the `ggplot2` system takes many of the cues from the base plotting system and from the `lattice` plotting systems, and formalizes the cues a bit.\n\nIt **automatically handles things like margins and spacing**, and also has the concept of \"themes\" which **provide a default set of plotting symbols and colors** (which are all customizable).\n\nWhile `ggplot2` bears a superficial similarity to `lattice`, `ggplot2` is generally easier and more intuitive to use.\n\n## The Basics: `qplot()`\n\nThe `qplot()` function in `ggplot2` is meant to get you going **q**uickly.\n\nIt works much like the `plot()` function in base graphics system. It **looks for variables to plot within a data frame**, similar to lattice, or in the parent environment.\n\nIn general, it is good to get used to putting your data in a data frame and then passing it to `qplot()`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Pro tip\n\nThe `qplot()` function is **somewhat discouraged** in `ggplot2` now and new users are encouraged to use the more general `ggplot()` function (more details in the next lesson).\n\nHowever, the `qplot()` function is still useful and may be easier to use if transitioning from the base plotting system or a different statistical package.\n:::\n\nPlots are made up of\n\n-   **aesthetics** (e.g. size, shape, color)\n-   **geoms** (e.g. points, lines)\n\nFactors play an important role for indicating subsets of the data (if they are to have different properties) so they should be **labeled** properly.\n\nThe `qplot()` hides much of what goes on underneath, which is okay for most operations, `ggplot()` is the core function and is very flexible for doing things `qplot()` cannot do.\n\n## Before you start: label your data\n\nOne thing that is always true, but is particularly useful when using `ggplot2`, is that you should always **use informative and descriptive labels on your data**. \n\nMore generally, your data should have appropriate **metadata** so that you can quickly look at a dataset and know\n\n-   what are variables?\n-   what do the values of each variable mean?\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Pro tip\n\n- **Each column** of a data frame should **have a meaningful (but concise) variable name** that accurately reflects the data stored in that column \n- Non-numeric or **categorical variables should be coded as factor variables** and have meaningful labels for each level of the factor. \n  - Might be common to code a binary variable as a \"0\" or a \"1\", but the problem is that from quickly looking at the data, it's impossible to know whether which level of that variable is represented by a \"0\" or a \"1\". \n  - Much better to simply label each observation as what they are. \n  - If a variable represents temperature categories, it might be better to use \"cold\", \"mild\", and \"hot\" rather than \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\".\n  \n:::\n\nWhile it is sometimes a pain to make sure all of your data are properly labeled, this **investment in time can pay dividends down the road** when you're trying to figure out what you were plotting. \n\nIn other words, including the proper metadata can make your exploratory plots essentially self-documenting.\n\n## ggplot2 \"Hello, world!\"\n\nThis example dataset comes with the `ggplot2` package and contains data on the fuel economy of 38 popular car models from 1999 to 2008.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # this loads the ggplot2 R package\n# library(ggplot2) # an alternative way to just load the ggplot2 R package\nglimpse(mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 234\nColumns: 11\n$ manufacturer <chr> \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"…\n$ model        <chr> \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4\", \"a4 quattro\", \"…\n$ displ        <dbl> 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0, 2.8, 2.8, 3.1, 1.8, 1.8, 2.0, 2.0, 2.…\n$ year         <int> 1999, 1999, 2008, 2008, 1999, 1999, 2008, 1999, 1999, 200…\n$ cyl          <int> 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, …\n$ trans        <chr> \"auto(l5)\", \"manual(m5)\", \"manual(m6)\", \"auto(av)\", \"auto…\n$ drv          <chr> \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4\", \"4…\n$ cty          <int> 18, 21, 20, 21, 16, 18, 18, 18, 16, 20, 19, 15, 17, 17, 1…\n$ hwy          <int> 29, 29, 31, 30, 26, 26, 27, 26, 25, 28, 27, 25, 25, 25, 2…\n$ fl           <chr> \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p…\n$ class        <chr> \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"compact\", \"c…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can see from the `glimpse()` (part of the `dplyr` package) output that all of the categorical variables (like \"manufacturer\" or \"class\") are **appropriately coded with meaningful label*s**. \n\nThis will come in handy when `qplot()` has to label different aspects of a plot. \n\nAlso note that all of the **columns/variables have meaningful names** (if sometimes abbreviated), rather than names like \"X1\", and \"X2\", etc.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Example\n\nWe can **make a quick scatterplot** using `qplot()` of the engine displacement (`displ`) and the highway miles per gallon (`hwy`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(x = displ, y = hwy, data = mpg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot of engine displacement and highway mileage using the mtcars dataset](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nIt has a *very* similar feeling to `plot()` in base R.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Note\n\nIn the call to `qplot()` you **must specify the `data` argument** so that `qplot()` knows where to look up the variables.\n\nYou must also specify `x` and `y`, but hopefully that part is obvious.\n\n:::\n\n## Modifying aesthetics\n\nWe can introduce a third variable into the plot by **modifying the color** of the points based on the value of that third variable.\n\nColor (or colour) is one type of **aesthetic** and using the `ggplot2` language:\n\n> \"the color of each point can be mapped to a variable\"\n\nThis sounds technical, but let's give an example.\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Example\n\nWe map the `color` argument to the `drv` variable, which indicates whether a car is front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, or 4-wheel drive.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Engine displacement and highway mileage by drive class](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nNow we can see that the front wheel drive cars tend to have lower displacement relative to the 4-wheel or rear wheel drive cars. \n\nAlso, it's clear that the 4-wheel drive cars have the lowest highway gas mileage.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Note\n\nThe `x` argument and `y` argument are aesthetics too, and they got mapped to the `displ` and `hwy` variables, respectively. \n\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### Question\n\nIn the above plot, I did not specify the `x` and `y` variable.

So technically this is three histograms on top of each other.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv, binwidth = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of highway mileage by drive class](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n\n### Question\n\nNotice, I used `fill` here to map color to the `drv` variable. Why is this? What happens when you use `color` instead?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# try it yourself\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nHaving the different colors for each drive class is nice, but the three histograms can be a bit difficult to separate out. \n\n**Side-by-side boxplots** are one solution to this problem.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(drv, hwy, data = mpg, geom = \"boxplot\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Boxplots of highway mileage by drive class](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother solution is to plot the histograms in separate panels using facets.\n\n## Facets\n\n**Facets** are a way to **create multiple panels of plots based on the levels of categorical variable**.\n\nHere, we want to see a histogram of the highway mileages and the categorical variable is the drive class variable. We can do that using the `facets` argument to `qplot()`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Note\n\nThe `facets` argument **expects a formula type of input**, with a `~` separating the left hand side variable and the right hand side variable. \n\n- The **left hand side** variable indicates how the rows of the panels should be divided\n- The **right hand side** variable indicates how the columns of the panels should be divided\n\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n### Example\n\nHere, we just want three rows of histograms (and just one column), one for each drive class, so we specify `drv` on the left hand side and `.` on the right hand side indicating that there's no variable there (it's empty).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(hwy, data = mpg, facets = drv ~ ., binwidth = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of highway mileage by drive class](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWe could also look at **more data using facets**, so instead of histograms we could look at scatter plots of engine displacement and highway mileage by drive class. \n\nHere, we put the `drv` variable on the right hand side to indicate that we want a column for each drive class (as opposed to splitting by rows like we did above).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, facets = . ~ drv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Engine displacement and highway mileage by drive class](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat if you wanted to **add a smoother to each one of those panels**?

The syntax is somewhere in between the base and lattice graphics system. The `qplot()` function is useful for quickly putting data on the page/screen, but for ultimate customization, it may make more sense to use some of the lower level functions that we discuss later in the next lesson.\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Case Study: MAACS Cohort\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click here for case study practicing the `qplot()` function.</summary>\n\nThis case study will use data based on the Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort Study (MAACS).

For the purposes of this lesson, we have simulated data that share many of the same features of the original data, but do not contain any of the actual measurements or values contained in the original dataset.\n:::\n\nHere is a snapshot of what the data look like.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nhere() starts at /Users/stephaniehicks/Documents/github/teaching/jhustatcomputing2022\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmaacs <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"maacs_sim.csv\"), col_types = \"icnn\")\nmaacs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 750 × 4\n      id mopos  pm25    eno\n   <int> <chr> <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1     1 yes    6.01  28.8 \n 2     2 no    25.2   17.7 \n 3     3 yes   21.8   43.6 \n 4     4 no    13.4  288.  \n 5     5 no    49.4    7.60\n 6     6 no    43.4   12.0 \n 7     7 yes   33.0   79.2 \n 8     8 yes   32.7   34.2 \n 9     9 yes   52.2   12.1 \n10    10 yes   51.9   65.0 \n# … with 740 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe key variables are:\n\n-   `mopos`: an indicator of whether the subject is allergic to mouse allergen (yes/no)\n\n-   `pm25`: average level of PM2.5 over the course of 7 days (micrograms per cubic meter)\n\n-   `eno`: exhaled nitric oxide\n\nThe outcome of interest for this analysis will be exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), which is a measure of pulmonary inflamation. We can get a sense of how eNO is distributed in this population by making a quick histogram of the variable. Here, we take the log of eNO because some right-skew in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(eno), data = maacs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

We can stratify the histogram by whether they are allergic to mouse.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(eno), data = maacs, fill = mopos)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

That said, there is significant overlap between the two groups.\n\nAn alternative to histograms is a density smoother, which sometimes can be easier to visualize when there are multiple groups. Here is a density smooth of the entire study population.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(eno), data = maacs, geom = \"density\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density smooth of log eNO](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd here are the densities straitified by allergic status. We can map the color aesthetic to the `mopos` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(eno), data = maacs, geom = \"density\", color = mopos)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density smooth of log eNO by mouse allergic status](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese tell the same story as the stratified histograms, which should come as no surprise.\n\nNow we can examine the indoor environment and its relationship to eNO. Here, we use the level of indoor PM2.5 as a measure of indoor environment air quality. We can make a simple scatterplot of PM2.5 and eNO.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, geom = c(\"point\", \"smooth\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![eNO and PM2.5](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe relationship appears modest at best, as there is substantial noise in the data. However, one question that we might be interested in is whether allergic individuals are perhaps more sensitive to PM2.5 inhalation than non-allergic individuals. To examine that question we can stratify the data into two groups.\n\nThis first plot uses different plot symbols for the two groups and overlays them on a single canvas. We can do this by mapping the `mopos` variable to the `shape` aesthetic.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, shape = mopos)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![eNO and PM2.5 by mouse allergic status](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBecause there is substantial overlap in the data it is a bit challenging to discern the circles from the triangles. Part of the reason might be that all of the symbols are the same color (black).\n\nWe can plot each group a different color to see if that helps.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, color = mopos)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![eNO and PM2.5 by mouse allergic status](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is slightly better but the substantial overlap makes it difficult to discern any trends in the data. For this we need to add a smoother of some sort. Here we add a linear regression line (a type of smoother) to each group to see if there's any difference.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, color = mopos) + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we see quite clearly that the red group and the green group exhibit rather different relationships between PM2.5 and eNO. For the non-allergic individuals, there appears to be a slightly negative relationship between PM2.5 and eNO and for the allergic individuals, there is a positive relationship. This suggests a strong interaction between PM2.5 and allergic status, an hypothesis perhaps worth following up on in greater detail than this brief exploratory analysis.\n\nAnother, and perhaps more clear, way to visualize this interaction is to use separate panels for the non-allergic and allergic individuals using the `facets` argument to `qplot()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, facets = . ~ mopos) + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.

Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?\n\n3.  Map a continuous variable to `color`, `size`, and `shape` aesthetics. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?\n:::\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation>\n-   <https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/lecture-the-ggplot2-plotting-system-part-1>\n:::\n",
